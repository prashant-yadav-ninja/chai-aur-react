It seems there might be a slight confusion in the terminology. I'll clarify.

In the context of web development, especially in the React JavaScript library, "reconciliation" and "Fiber" refer to related but distinct concepts.

Reconciliation:

Reconciliation is the process by which React updates the user interface to match the most recent state.
When your application's state changes, React needs to figure out what parts of the UI need to be updated to reflect that change.
The reconciler is the part of React responsible for this process. It compares the new state with the previous state and determines the most efficient way to update the UI.
Fiber:

Fiber is an internal implementation detail of React's reconciler.
It is essentially a reimplementation of the React core algorithm. It was introduced to make the process of reconciliation more incremental and interruptible.
The goal of Fiber is to improve the performance and responsiveness of React applications, especially in cases where there are large and complex component trees.
In simple terms, reconciliation is the broader concept of updating the UI based on state changes, and Fiber is a specific, more efficient way that React has implemented to carry out this reconciliation process.

So, in summary, Fiber is a specific approach to reconciliation used internally by React. They are related concepts, but reconciliation is a broader term that encompasses the entire process, while Fiber is a specific implementation to make that process more efficient.
